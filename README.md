## Trading Workflow

The `trading_workflow.json` file contains a simple example of an n8n workflow for a trading bot. The workflow is split into three nodes that illustrate the core logic:

1. **Market Data** – An `HTTP Request` node that queries an exchange API for the latest ticker information.
2. **Trading Condition** – An `IF` node that checks whether the returned price meets a predefined target. This represents the decision logic, which can be as simple or complex as needed.
3. **Notification** – An `Email` node that notifies you whenever the condition is met. It shows how to integrate alerts after processing the data.

This basic workflow highlights a straightforward setup. More advanced strategies could chain additional nodes for order execution or multiple conditions.
